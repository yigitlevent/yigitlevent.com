				</Typography>

				<Typography>
					A boilerplate for desktop development via electron, react, scss, and typescript. Configuration and the codebase are minimal. It also has hot-reloading of the project configured. Versions of electron and other packages used here are probably very old now.

				</Typography>

				<Typography>
					My interest in linguistics led me to creating a conlang. This small app was created to help me keep track of the dictionary. I might revisit this in the future and add it to this website.

				<Typography>
					This was another tabletop game utility, this time for VtR 5e. It included character generation utilities and a database connection via supabase. There also was a companion project to this, <Link href="https://github.com/yigitlevent/autarkis-bot" sx={{ textDecoration: "none" }}>Autarkis Bot</Link>, which was a discord bot that rolled dice and such.

				</Typography>

				<Typography>
					Yet another tabletop game utility. This time for the game Degenesis (it has great art by the way, if that's your thing). This one used a proper backend with expressjs and postgresql and such.
