		description: "Monochromatic elves with a strong sensitivity to sunlight. The lands surrounding the Heart are predominantly populated by dark elves, including the towering city of Spire (where they are subjugated by the aelfir) and the rolling desert caravan city of Aliquam. Drow live to around a hundred years of age, but the cruel conditions of Spire means that few of them reach 50. Drow do not give birth to viable young —instead, they lay fist-sized fleshy eggs that must be tended to for months until they develop into an infant.\nDrow regularly find their way into the Heart, either actively fleeing Spire or trying to find someone or something to call their own in the depths. Some are pilgrims tracing fragmented maps to find the Moon Beneath, tired of the state-mandated religions in Spire.\nThe Drow of Spire predominantly worship Our Glorious Lady, a facet of their once-tripartite moon goddess; venerating the other two facets is forbidden. This religion focuses on six primary virtues, and it is considered good and proper for a drow to live their life in accordance with them: Community, Sagacity, Fury, Grace, Tenacity and Vigilance.",

They have emerged from their scattered island nations in the Eastern Kingdoms bearing retroengineered technology, and are eager to sell it to the highest bidder. Humans live brief but bright lives in the eyes of the elves, passing away at 60 or so, often from illness or injury.\nThe discovery of spireblack processing and the resulting rise in arms manufacture is almost entirely their doing.

Some turn away from a life of power to seek meaning in the lawless city below, while others pursue the dark secrets whispered about in perfumed boudoirs. They are tall, impossibly graceful and can sustain their lives supposedly indefinitely with curious rituals and surgeries. Aelfir in the City Above wear masks to hide their faces from their inferiors; in the City Beneath, only traditionalists wear them.\nIn the City Above, their rule is cruel and capricious; it is self-serving and deleterious to those around them. When venturing into the City Below, most aelfir know that they lost any authority as soon as they passed through Derelictus. Many have adjusted to their new place in life.

In the confines of the Heart, where the gaps between realities are thin, they can achieve unthought-of results in mechanoccultism —and great machines from ages past thrum and whirr in the hidden depths, just waiting to be found.\nGnolls have a reputation for being angry, bestial warriors— but a lot of this is propaganda on the part of the aelfir, and they're no more warlike than any other people.
