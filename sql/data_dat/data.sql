Detecting soft foot steps on a stone floor, impressions on a piece of paper, cracks in a vial or the breeze through a keyhole, for example. If used in a versus test against Stealthy, Touch of the Devil counts as Observation. Surgery, Pottery, Carpentry, Sewing, Whitesmithing, Etching, Engraving, Carving, Lapidary and jewelcraft may root from Gray Perception.

After being humiliated in a social skill test or Duel of Wits, such visions become irresistible. While Brooding, the Orc player may design a Flight of Murderous Fancy to focus on.

Not only do they aid one another on the hunt -ravens will circle a herd to mark it for wolves, and wolves will allow ravens to feed at their kills- they are also great friends. Wolves and ravens enjoy taunting each other and playing endless and dangerous games of tak. This trait grants either a free relationship with a raven or a 1D affiliation with a conspiracy of ravens.<br>This trait signifies a wolf who is especially fond of ravens and well though of by the birds. While the whole pack may play, he is the only pack member who can understand the quacks and squawks of raven speech.'),
	(1156, 'Shadow Coat', 6, 6, 1, 2, 'The fur of this wolf is perfectly suited to stalking in the shadows of the woods. Use this trait as a call-on for Stealthy when stalking the forests and valleys.');
